              Hi, my name is Anuran Datta. I am from Kolkata and I have almost 2
              decade of corporate experiences on application software services
              with diverse software horizontals and verticals as well as
              Clients.

              I liked the Serverless architectural pattern and concepts, so I
              started building this site/platform fully on the AWS Serverless
              echosystem. It is using Angular for SPA, Okta for 3rd party IP and
              Quarkus for cloud-native Java microservice, deployed as AWS
              Lambda. Other parts of the architecture depicted in diagram below.
